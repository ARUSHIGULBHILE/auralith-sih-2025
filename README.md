| Team Member 5   | Data & QA                | Simulated datasets, testing, emergency scenario setup |



## 2. Project Overview

AstroMate X is an AI-driven software companion for astronauts. It:

- Predicts cognitive fatigue & error risks (Cognitive Digital Twin).  
- Optimizes daily schedules and circadian rhythms.  
- Simulates emergency scenarios and provides step-by-step guidance.  
- Acts as a text/voice companion for mental well-being.  
- Includes both Astronaut UI and Ground-Control dashboard.  

**Objective:** Improve astronaut autonomy, safety, and mental well-being during long-duration missions.



## 3. Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Cognitive Twin Model | AI predicts fatigue & error risk per astronaut. |
| Schedule Optimizer | AI-based scheduling for tasks, sleep, and exercise. |
| Emergency Simulation | Oxygen leak, CO₂ rise, or communication loss scenarios. |
| Emotional Companion | Text/voice assistant with micro-interventions. |
| Training Mode | 2D/3D simulation of emergency procedures. |
| Dual Mode | Astronaut UI (simple) + Ground Control dashboard (detailed). |

## 5. Setup & Run

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
source .venv/Scripts/activate
# Linux / Mac
# source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
````

* **Swagger Docs:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend_new
npm install
npm start
```

* **App URL:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 6. Workflow & Collaboration

* **Branches:** `main` (stable), `dev` (active development), `feature-*` (specific features)
* **Commits:** `[type]: description` (e.g., `feat: add fatigue predictor`)
* **Merge:** PRs into `dev` first, then `main` after review
* **Team Communication:** Slack/Discord for discussion, GitHub Issues for tasks

---

## 7. How It Works

* **Backend:** Generates simulated astronaut data
* **Cognitive Twin:** Predicts fatigue & error risk
* **Scheduling Engine:** Optimizes astronaut tasks & sleep
* **Emergency Scenarios:** Can be triggered; system auto-adjusts & alerts
* **Frontend:** Displays astronaut metrics & ground-control dashboard
* **Text/Voice Assistant:** Supports mental health check-ins and checklists
